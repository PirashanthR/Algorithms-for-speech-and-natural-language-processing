#Â Algorithms for speech and natural language processing



This repository contains my handings for the Algorithms for speech and natural language processing class: http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/algorithms-for-speech-and-natural-language-processing-380821.kjsp?RH=1242430202531

Github repo for the course: https://github.com/edupoux/MVA_2018_SL

This repository contains five assignments: 
* TP1: Speech commands recognitions using MFCC and basic algorithms
* TP2: FST (Edit distance, language models ...)
* TP3: The goal of this assignment was normalizing tweets (especially correcting misspelling errors using Context2Vec algorithm and The Edit distance)
* TP4: Building a probabilistic parser from the bottom without any libraries in order to do all the fundamental tasks (nltk has been used in order to deal with unknown vocabulary) 
* TP5: What is the current state of the art in machine translation (nmt, test on google translates ...)
